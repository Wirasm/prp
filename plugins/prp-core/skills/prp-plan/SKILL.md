name: prp-plan
description: Create comprehensive feature implementation plan with codebase analysis and research. Also wires bidirectional back/forward references between existing plans (the update-references workflow). Use when the user wants to plan a feature, turn a PRD into an implementation plan, "link two plans", "add a back/forward reference", "connect related plans", or invokes /prp-plan.

<objective>
Transform "$ARGUMENTS" into a battle-tested implementation plan through systematic codebase exploration, pattern extraction, and strategic research.

**Core Principle**: PLAN ONLY - no code written. Create a context-rich document that enables one-pass implementation success.

**Execution Order**: CODEBASE FIRST, RESEARCH SECOND. Solutions must fit existing patterns before introducing new ones.

**Agent Strategy**: Use specialized agents for intelligence gathering:
- `prp-core:codebase-explorer` — finds WHERE code lives and extracts implementation patterns
- `prp-core:codebase-analyst` — analyzes HOW integration points work and traces data flow
- `prp-core:web-researcher` — strategic web research with citations and gap analysis

Launch codebase agents in parallel first, then research agent second.
</objective>

<context>
CLAUDE.md rules: @CLAUDE.md

**Directory Discovery** (run these to understand project structure):
- List root contents: `ls -la`
- Find main source directories: `ls -la */ 2>/dev/null | head -50`
- Identify project type from config files (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT assume `src/` exists. Common alternatives include:
- `app/` (Next.js, Rails, Laravel)
- `lib/` (Ruby gems, Elixir)
- `packages/` (monorepos)
- `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` (Go)
- Root-level source files (Python, scripts)

Discover the actual structure before proceeding.
</context>

<process>

## Mode Select

Before planning, check intent:

- **Link / connect two existing plans** — the request is to wire a back/forward reference between plans (e.g. "link plan A to plan B", "this plan builds on that one", `update-references <plan> <related> [back|forward]`). → Follow `workflows/update-references.md` and stop. Do NOT run the planning phases below.
- **Create / update a plan** (the default) — anything that describes a feature, hands over a PRD, or otherwise asks for an implementation plan. → Continue with Phase 0 below.

---

## Phase 0: DETECT - Input Type Resolution

**Determine input type:**

| Input Pattern | Type | Action |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Ends with `.prd.md` | PRD file | Parse PRD, select next phase |
| Ends with `.md` and contains "Implementation Phases" | PRD file | Parse PRD, select next phase |
| File path that exists | Document | Read and extract feature description |
| Free-form text | Description | Use directly as feature input |
| Empty/blank | Conversation | Use conversation context as input |

### If PRD File Detected:

1. **Read the PRD file**
2. **Parse the Implementation Phases table** - find rows with `Status: pending`
3. **Check dependencies** - only select phases whose dependencies are `complete`
4. **Select the next actionable phase:**
   - First pending phase with all dependencies complete
   - If multiple candidates with same dependencies, note parallelism opportunity

5. **Extract phase context:**
   ```
   PHASE: {phase number and name}
   GOAL: {from phase details}
   SCOPE: {from phase details}
   SUCCESS SIGNAL: {from phase details}
   PRD CONTEXT: {problem statement, user, hypothesis from PRD}
   ```

6. **Report selection to user:**
   ```
   PRD: {prd file path}
   Selected Phase: #{number} - {name}

   {If parallel phases available:}
   Note: Phase {X} can also run in parallel (in separate worktree).

   Proceeding with Phase #{number}...
   ```

### If Free-form or Conversation Context:

- Proceed directly to Phase 1 with the input as feature description

**PHASE_0_CHECKPOINT:**
- [ ] Input type determined
- [ ] If PRD: next phase selected and dependencies verified
- [ ] Feature description ready for Phase 1

---

## Phase 1: PARSE - Feature Understanding

**EXTRACT from input:**

- Core problem being solved
- User value and business impact
- Feature type: NEW_CAPABILITY | ENHANCEMENT | REFACTOR | BUG_FIX
- Complexity: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
- Affected systems list

**FORMULATE user story:**

```
As a <user type>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>
```

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Problem statement is specific and testable
- [ ] User story follows correct format
- [ ] Complexity assessment has rationale
- [ ] Affected systems identified

**GATE**: If requirements are AMBIGUOUS → STOP and ASK user for clarification before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: EXPLORE - Codebase Intelligence

**CRITICAL: Launch two specialized agents in parallel using multiple Task tool calls in a single message.**

### Agent 1: `prp-core:codebase-explorer`

Finds WHERE code lives and extracts implementation patterns.

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-explorer"`:

```
Find all code relevant to implementing: [feature description].

LOCATE:
1. Similar implementations - analogous features with file:line references
2. Naming conventions - actual examples of function/class/file naming
3. Error handling patterns - how errors are created, thrown, caught
4. Logging patterns - logger usage, message formats
5. Type definitions - relevant interfaces and types
6. Test patterns - test file structure, assertion styles, test file locations
7. Configuration - relevant config files and settings
8. Dependencies - relevant libraries already in use

Categorize findings by purpose (implementation, tests, config, types, docs).
Return ACTUAL code snippets from codebase, not generic examples.
```

### Agent 2: `prp-core:codebase-analyst`

Analyzes HOW integration points work and traces data flow.

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-analyst"`:

```
Analyze the implementation details relevant to: [feature description].

TRACE:
1. Entry points - where new code will connect to existing code
2. Data flow - how data moves through related components
3. State changes - side effects in related functions
4. Contracts - interfaces and expectations between components
5. Patterns in use - design patterns and architectural decisions

Document what exists with precise file:line references. No suggestions or improvements.
```

### Merge Agent Results

Combine findings from both agents into a unified discovery table:

| Category | File:Lines                                  | Pattern Description  | Code Snippet                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| NAMING   | `src/features/X/service.ts:10-15`           | camelCase functions  | `export function createThing()`           |
| ERRORS   | `src/features/X/errors.ts:5-20`             | Custom error classes | `class ThingNotFoundError`                |
| LOGGING  | `src/core/logging/index.ts:1-10`            | getLogger pattern    | `const logger = getLogger("domain")`      |
| TESTS    | `src/features/X/tests/service.test.ts:1-30` | describe/it blocks   | `describe("service", () => {`             |
| TYPES    | `src/features/X/models.ts:1-20`             | Drizzle inference    | `type Thing = typeof things.$inferSelect` |
| FLOW     | `src/features/X/service.ts:40-60`           | Data transformation  | `input → validate → persist → respond`    |

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Both agents (`prp-core:codebase-explorer` and `prp-core:codebase-analyst`) launched in parallel and completed
- [ ] At least 3 similar implementations found with file:line refs
- [ ] Code snippets are ACTUAL (copy-pasted from codebase, not invented)
- [ ] Integration points mapped with data flow traces
- [ ] Dependencies cataloged with versions from package.json

---

## Phase 3: RESEARCH - External Documentation

**ONLY AFTER Phase 2 is complete** - solutions must fit existing codebase patterns first.

**Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:web-researcher"`:**

```
Research external documentation relevant to implementing: [feature description].

FIND:
1. Official documentation for involved libraries (match versions from package.json: [list relevant deps and versions])
2. Known gotchas, breaking changes, deprecations for these versions
3. Security considerations and best practices
4. Performance optimization patterns

VERSION CONSTRAINTS:
- [library]: v{version} (from package.json)
- [library]: v{version}

Return findings with:
- Direct links to specific doc sections (not just homepages)
- Key insights that affect implementation
- Gotchas with mitigation strategies
- Any conflicts between docs and existing codebase patterns found in Phase 2
```

**FORMAT the agent's findings into plan references:**

```markdown
- [Library Docs v{version}](https://url#specific-section)
  - KEY_INSIGHT: {what we learned that affects implementation}
  - APPLIES_TO: {which task/file this affects}
  - GOTCHA: {potential pitfall and how to avoid}
```

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] `prp-core:web-researcher` agent launched and completed
- [ ] Documentation versions match package.json
- [ ] URLs include specific section anchors (not just homepage)
- [ ] Gotchas documented with mitigation strategies
- [ ] No conflicting patterns between external docs and existing codebase

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Before state accurately reflects current system behavior
- [ ] After state shows ALL new capabilities
- [ ] Data flows are traceable from input to output
- [ ] User value is explicit and measurable

---

## Phase 5: ARCHITECT - Strategic Design

**For complex features with multiple integration points**, use `prp-core:codebase-analyst` to trace how existing architecture works at the integration points identified in Phase 2:

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="prp-core:codebase-analyst"`:

```
Analyze the architecture around these integration points for: [feature description].

INTEGRATION POINTS (from Phase 2):
- [entry point 1 from explorer/analyst findings]
- [entry point 2]

ANALYZE:
1. How data flows through each integration point
2. What contracts exist between components
3. What side effects occur at each stage
4. What error handling patterns are in place

Document what exists with precise file:line references. No suggestions.
```

**Then ANALYZE deeply (use extended thinking if needed):**

- ARCHITECTURE_FIT: How does this integrate with the existing architecture?
- EXECUTION_ORDER: What must happen first → second → third?
- FAILURE_MODES: Edge cases, race conditions, error scenarios?
- PERFORMANCE: Will this scale? Database queries optimized?
- SECURITY: Attack vectors? Data exposure risks? Auth/authz?
- MAINTAINABILITY: Will future devs understand this code?

**DECIDE and document:**

```markdown
APPROACH_CHOSEN: [description]
RATIONALE: [why this over alternatives - reference codebase patterns]

ALTERNATIVES_REJECTED:

- [Alternative 1]: Rejected because [specific reason]
- [Alternative 2]: Rejected because [specific reason]

NOT_BUILDING (explicit scope limits):

- [Item 1 - explicitly out of scope and why]
- [Item 2 - explicitly out of scope and why]
```

**PHASE_5_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Approach aligns with existing architecture and patterns
- [ ] Dependencies ordered correctly (types → repository → service → routes)
- [ ] Edge cases identified with specific mitigation strategies
- [ ] Scope boundaries are explicit and justified

---

## Phase 6: GENERATE - Implementation Plan File

**OUTPUT_PATH**: `.claude/PRPs/plans/{kebab-case-feature-name}.plan.md`

Create directory if needed: `mkdir -p .claude/PRPs/plans`

**PLAN_STRUCTURE**: Read `templates/plan-template.md` now (mandatory) — it is the exact plan document to fill and save. Keep every section heading; fill every `{placeholder}` with real, project-specific content (the template's task entries and snippets are illustrative examples from one TypeScript project, not content to keep).

</process>

<output>
**OUTPUT_FILE**: `.claude/PRPs/plans/{kebab-case-feature-name}.plan.md`

**If input was from PRD file**, also update the PRD:

1. **Update phase status** in the Implementation Phases table:
   - Change the phase's Status from `pending` to `in-progress`
   - Add the plan file path to the PRP Plan column

2. **Edit the PRD file** with these changes

**REPORT_TO_USER** (display after creating plan):

```markdown
## Plan Created

**File**: `.claude/PRPs/plans/{feature-name}.plan.md`

{If from PRD:}
**Source PRD**: `{prd-file-path}`
**Phase**: #{number} - {phase name}
**PRD Updated**: Status set to `in-progress`, plan linked

{If parallel phases available:}
**Parallel Opportunity**: Phase {X} can run concurrently in a separate worktree.
To start: `git worktree add -b phase-{X} ../project-phase-{X} && cd ../project-phase-{X} && /prp-plan {prd-path}`

**Summary**: {2-3 sentence feature overview}

**Complexity**: {LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH} - {brief rationale}

**Scope**:
- {N} files to CREATE
- {M} files to UPDATE
- {K} total tasks

**Key Patterns Discovered**:
- {Pattern 1 from codebase-explorer/analyst with file:line}
- {Pattern 2 from codebase-explorer/analyst with file:line}

**External Research**:
- {Key doc 1 with version}
- {Key doc 2 with version}

**UX Transformation**:
- BEFORE: {one-line current state}
- AFTER: {one-line new state}

**Risks**:
- {Primary risk}: {mitigation}

**Confidence Score**: {1-10}/10 for one-pass implementation success
- {Rationale for score}

**Next Step**: To execute, run: `/prp-implement .claude/PRPs/plans/{feature-name}.plan.md`
```

</output>
